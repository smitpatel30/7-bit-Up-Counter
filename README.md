# 7-bit-Up-Counter
In this project, I have designed a 7-bit synchronous up counter. It wil start from a decimal number of 103 (according to my preset state) and will end at a decimal value of 127. After then, it will roll over to the 0 and will count further from 0 to 127. In this way, the counter will cover the whole range from 0 to 127 with a starting state of 103.
